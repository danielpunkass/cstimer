It is preferred to use HTTPS protocol to visit csTimer. Although HTTP is available, some functions might not work correctly, e.g. stackmatTimer, WCA login, etc.


# Using as Native APP

Currently, csTimer is able to work as a native app on mobile devices owing to [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/). Thus, when you open csTimer by chrome or some other modern browser on mobile devices, it will ask you whether to add csTimer to home screen. Then, you can use csTimer as a native app that also works without network access.


# Translation

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/cstimer/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/cstimer)

If you are willing to help translating cstimer into your native language, please go to [this](https://crowdin.com/project/cstimer) page and select your language. If your native language is not on the list, just contact me and I'll add it.


# Data Storage

Currently, all data (including settings, session data, etc) are stored in user browser's storage. More specificently, all settings are stored in localStorage, while session data (except session meta data) are stored in indexedDB or localStorage if indexedDB is not available.

Therefore, all data will be lost if you clear browser cache. For avoiding data loss, you might use the "export" function to export/import all your data to/from a file, csTimer's server or google storage.

# Data Imported to csTimer's Server / Google Storage

After [8280fda](https://github.com/cs0x7f/cstimer/commit/8280fdab9628c605c9abc1bc4a127e3e84016542), you are able to download data that is uploaded before the latest one from csTimer's Server / Google Storage, which might be useful for a mis-uploading. For Google Storage, csTimer will keep 10 latest uploaded data. For csTimer's server, 10 or more latest uploaded data will be kept. More specificently, I'll keep 10 latest uploaded data while others might be deleted due to our limited disk resource.


# Third-party Deployment

Some functions of csTimer might not work properly for domains except "cstimer.net", especially online-based export/import functions due to callback address verification. If you want to make csTimer work as a part of your own website, it is recommended to use <iframe>.


# csTimer module

After [cb6c4266](https://github.com/cs0x7f/cstimer/commit/cb6c42667dc5e68717b2d5ac8fb0623f87a5f1cd), you may use some functions of csTimer by the npm package [cstimer_module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cstimer_module), e.g. amounts of scrambles. For specific usage, please refer to npm. If you have any problems, you can directly create issues in this project.

# Docker

## Local Development

To run csTimer in a Docker container locally:

```bash
cd Docker
docker compose up --build
```

Now you can access csTimer at http://localhost:8080/ or https://localhost:8888/. Note that if you use the HTTPS version you will have to "trust" the self-signed certificate.

To build the "dist" version of the app and serve it locally, build with `DEPLOY=1` defined:

```bash
cd Docker
DEPLOY=1 docker compose up --build
```

## Google Cloud Deployment

### Quick Start

1. **Setup (one-time):**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env - set your PROJECT_ID
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. **Deploy everything:**
   ```bash
   export PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   ./scripts/deploy-all.sh
   ```

### What it does:
- Builds optimized Docker image with faster PHP-FPM startup
- Pushes to Google Container Registry
- Deploys to Cloud Run with gen2 + CPU boost for faster cold starts
- Scales to 0 when idle (saves money) but prevents 502 errors
- Tests deployment and provides service URL

### Individual commands:
- `./scripts/build.sh` - Just build and push image
- `./scripts/deploy.sh` - Just deploy existing image
- `./scripts/health-check.sh` - Test cold start performance
